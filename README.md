## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>AgriShield: Smart Farming for a Changing Climate</h3>
<p> The proposed solution is a multilingual, AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System designed to help small and marginal farmers mitigate environmental and climate risks by providing real-time, location-specific guidance. It directly addresses the problem by reducing farmers’ dependence on guesswork and unreliable advice, instead offering scientific recommendations on crop selection, eco-friendly fertilizer use, and water conservation practices, all tailored to their soil, weather, and crop history. Leveraging weather forecasts, satellite imagery, and IoT sensors, the system predicts droughts, floods, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks while recommending climate-resilient crops and efficient irrigation methods to safeguard yields. Its innovation and uniqueness lie in features like a dynamic “climate risk score” that shows farm-level vulnerability, a digital farm twin that simulates future weather impacts, and a gamified advisory model that rewards eco-friendly practices. Additionally, the system integrates government insurance and subsidy schemes, sends community-wide climate alerts, and provides vernacular voice support for low-literate farmers. By combining AI-driven insights with local knowledge sharing, the solution empowers farmers to adopt sustainable, climate-smart methods, reducing crop losses, improving incomes, and protecting natural resources.</p>

## Technical Approach
<h3>Climate-Smart Crop Tech</h3>
<p> The Smart Crop Advisory System integrates AI/ML models, IoT devices, and remote sensing data to provide climate-resilient advisory services. Farmers onboard through a multilingual app or chatbot by entering details such as land size, soil type, and preferred crops. Weather APIs (IMD, OpenWeather, NASA), satellite imagery, and IoT sensors for soil moisture, pH, and nutrients are analyzed using machine learning to predict droughts, floods, heatwaves, and pest or disease outbreaks. Each farm receives a “climate risk score” and a “digital farm twin” simulation that shows how future weather conditions may affect crops, enabling preventive actions. Advisory services are delivered via app dashboards, SMS, voice support, and community alerts to ensure accessibility in low-connectivity regions. Recommendations cover climate-resilient crops, efficient irrigation, sustainable fertilizer use, and eco-friendly pest management, while integration with government databases suggests subsidies, insurance, and disaster relief schemes. The system uses Python for AI, JavaScript/TypeScript for app and backend, and C/C++ for IoT, with TensorFlow/PyTorch, React Native/Flutter, and Node.js/Django REST as core frameworks. Data is stored in PostgreSQL and MongoDB, with deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure. Hardware like soil sensors, weather stations, and optional drones enhance monitoring. The process involves farmer onboarding, data acquisition, AI-driven risk prediction, advisory generation, government scheme integration, and continuous feedback to refine models for greater accuracy and adaptability.</p>




## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>Technical and Operational Viability</h3>
<p> The climate-smart crop advisory system is highly feasible due to growing smartphone use in rural India, government open-data availability, and affordable IoT sensors. It leverages AI/ML frameworks, cloud services, and mobile apps for scalable, cost-effective deployment. Challenges include low digital literacy, limited connectivity, trust barriers, and initial resistance to new practices. These can be addressed with vernacular voice support, offline functionality, farmer training through NGOs and local officers, pilot programs, and gamified eco-friendly practices. Continuous feedback and AI model refinement ensure the system remains adaptive, helping farmers mitigate climate risks, improve yields, and adopt sustainable farming methods.</p>

## Impact and Benefits
<h3>Impact on Farmers and Environment</h3>
<p> The Smart Crop Advisory System for environmental and climate risks empowers small and marginal farmers to make data-driven decisions that reduce vulnerability to droughts, floods, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks. By providing climate-resilient crop recommendations, efficient irrigation guidance, and eco-friendly pest and fertilizer management, it helps increase yields and incomes while minimizing environmental damage. Integration with government schemes ensures financial protection through subsidies and crop insurance. The system also promotes sustainable farming practices, conserves soil and water resources, and builds community resilience, creating long-term social, economic, and environmental benefits for rural agricultural regions.</p>
